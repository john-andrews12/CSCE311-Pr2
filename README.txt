PREREQUISITES:
The programs in this project should be run on one of the lab machines in the
Linux labs in Swearingen Engineerinng Center.

RUNNING THE PROGRAMS
For each section of the report, there is an associated code snippet. To view
these snippet simply use cat <file name> to view the content of the files (note
that one should be in the directory containing the files before running this
command). To execute the files, one must first create the executables for each.
Here is the associated commands for each file to get the executables

FILE NAME
COMMAND
----------------
hello_world.cc
make HelloOb

input.cc
make InputOb

square.cc
make FunctionOb

array_sum.cc
make ArrayOb

extern_int.cc
make ExternIntOb

array_sum_un.cc
make ArrayUnOb

process_simulator.cc
make ProcSimOb

To run each execuatable, simply type 
./<executable name> 
where the <executable name> is the word that followed make in each of the above
commands

NOTICE
The reponses to the report questions, as well as the content pertaining to sub
project 2 are both in the .pdf file within the submission folder.
